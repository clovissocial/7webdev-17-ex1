            console.log(3+2); //It sums the 2 numbers and returns an output of 5

            console.log(typeof(3)); // It returns the operator type of '3' which is number

            console.log(typeof(3) === typeof(4.32)); // It compares the two methods and see if they are of the same operators

            console.log(5/0); // It returns a data type of infinity since as a number cannot be divisible by 0

            console.log(3 / "bob"); // It returns an output of 'Not a Number' (NaN) which shows that a number cannot be divisible by a string

            console.log(NaN === NaN); // ***It gives a boolean of false because the first 'NaN' is considered as a type of number in Javascript and when the second is assigned to the 1st one,
            //it consideres the second as the value of the first which gives false as the output. 

            console.log(typeof(NaN)); // It returns an output of 'number' which shows that NaN is a number data type in JavaScript

            console.log(Math.pow(2, 3)); // It returns an output of 8 because the power method is used and 2 is raised to the power 3 which gives 8.
                                         // All this is with the help of the Math function in java script.

            var first_name = "cindy"; // In the following expression, the var keyword is being declared which accepts a variable name.
            console.log(first_name); // This variable name (first_name) now stores the value of the string "cindy".
  
            var hello; // The value of the hello variable is a string.

            var y;
             // It returns the value of cool because that's the value that has been assigned to the variable "y";
            console.log(y === "cool");

            console.log("some" + "person"); // The 2 strings are being concatenated and read as a single sentence. NB:"There isn't space between the some and person when outputed"

            var first = "Bart";
            var last = "Simpson";
            console.log(first + " " + last); // The 1st and 2nd variable are being concatenated together and read as a name (Bart Simpson), with the help of the quotes providing the space between the 2 words.

            console.log("cool".length); // Provide the number or length of word in the string "cool".

            console.log("phat" === "phat"); // Compares if the 2 strings are the same in the letters and produce a boolean value of true.

            console.log(typeof("cats")); // produces an output of "string" indicating that it is a string data type.

            console.log(3 + "bob"); // produces an output of "3bob" which indicates that +operator concatenates both values as astring.

            console.log(Math.ceil(4.87)); // The output is 5. This is because the ceil method rounds down the floating point number to the nearest integer which is 5

            console.log(6/"2"); // It returns 3 as the answer

            console.log(3 * "bob"); // It gives an output of NaN because a number and a string data type cannot be multiplied and javascript doesn't recognize it as a valid number.

            var x;// The variable is being declared as x.
            var y;// The variable is being declared as y.

           var hobby = "programming"; // The string "programming" is being assigned to the variable "hobby".
           console.log(hobby);

           var sport;
           console.log(sport === undefined); // It returns a boolean of true because the variable sport has not been declared any value.

           console.log(typeof("Programmer"));
